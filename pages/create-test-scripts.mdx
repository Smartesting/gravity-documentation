Gravity accelerates the production of end-to-end test scripts. From a session page, you can quickly get a test reproducing the sequence of actions of this session and avoid the cumbersome task of finding the right selectors you need to tell your automation framework how to interact with your frontend code.

<Alert type={AlertType.warning}>
  Gravity does not handle assertions and test data yet, nor can it reuse your existing testing custom methods.
</Alert>

<Alert type={AlertType.info}>
  The scripts are compatible with Cypress v10.3 and further versions.
  We will add new compatibilities soon.
</Alert>

You have two available options: downloading a bootstrap project or getting a single test.

## Get a bootstrap project

You will get an archive file containing:

- ```README.md``` instructions to help you setup and execute your test
- ```package.json``` containing the minimal dependencies
- An ```e2e``` folder containing the test generated from the session

## Export only one test

Get the test for the current session ready to be copied into your code
