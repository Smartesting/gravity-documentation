Gravity is a **Usage-Driven Testing platform**, meaning you need usage data to make it work. On this page, learn how to start collecting usage data from your application and send them to Gravity.

## Pre-requisites

- Gravity account
- Web-based application

## Installation

<Alert type={AlertType.warning}>
  We support only web-based applications for now. We might support mobile and/or desktop applications in the future.
</Alert>

### Get your authentication keys

- Go to the **Configuration** page of your domain. If you do not have any data yet, you will automatically be redirected to this page.
- Get the key for your production environment. Its role is to let Gravity knows that the data should be stored as **actual "User"** sessions.
- Get the key for your testing environment. Its role is to let Gravity knows that the data should be stored as **"Test"** sessions.

<Alert type={AlertType.info} title="Why two keys?">
  Gravity helps you to decide what end-to-end tests should be integrated in your test suite. In order to do so, it compares what your users actually do against what you test.
  That's why you need to set up the collector on both environments to get all the value of Gravity.

### Install the JavaScript library

<Alert type={AlertType.info}>
  Our data collector is open-source. You can check it out here: https://github.com/Smartesting/gravity-data-collector
</Alert>

<Alert type={AlertType.info}>
  This library is designed to work in a **browser**. Do not install it in a Node environment
</Alert>

Here are the multiple ways to install the collector. Pick the one that matches with your tool stack:

#### NPM
```
  npm install gravity-data-collector
```

#### Yarn
```
  yarn add gravity-data-collector
```

#### CDN
```
<script async id="logger" type="text/javascript"
  src="https://unpkg.com/@smartesting/gravity-data-collector/dist/gravity-logger-min.js">
</script>
```

#### Add it to your ```package.json``` file
```
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@smartesting/gravity-data-collector": "^2.1.9"
  }
}
```


### Authorize domain (production only)

You ***must*** tell Gravity from which domain name the collector will send data. It allows you to ensure the data have been sent by you and not someone else on your behalf.

Just enter the domain name in the dedicated field (no need to prepend ```http``` or ```https://```)

### Initialize the script

Once the collector has been correctly installed, you must tell it when to start. It only takes
a simple line of code:

```
import GravityCollector from '@smartesting/gravity-data-collector/dist'

GravityCollector.init({
 authKey: '<Production or test environment key>'
})
```

You will usually paste this code into your application entry point (```index.js|html|...```), but nothing prevents you doing it anywhere else (for example, if you want to focus only on a specific part of your application)

## What data are collected?

Once initialized, the script will automatically record information and send them to your Gravity domain:

- **Session started** When the collector is initialized, it sends a "Session started" event so you can track when the current user started to interact with your application
- **Click** triggered when the current user clicks somewhere in the GUI of your application
- **Fill** triggered when the current user changes the value of an input field
- **Check** triggered when the current user interacts with a check box
- **Press key/release key** triggered when a user press/release a key of their keyboard

## Metadata

A set of metadata is sent with every recorded event:

- **Location** information about the page where the event has been recorded
- **Viewport** information about the device used by the current user
- **Data** event-specific data (for example: in the case of a **Click**, it contains the coordinates of the pointer when the event happened)
- **Target** data related to the HTML element the current user interacted with


export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>
