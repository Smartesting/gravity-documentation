The **Sessions** section of Gravity allows you to browse the recorded user and test sessions so you can have a first glimpse into how your application is used

## Finding sessions
By default, all the sessions ever collected are displayed, grouped by environments (user/test).
Filters is a first step to make sense of these data:

<Image
    src={imgSessionsFilter}
    alt="You can filter sessions from the sessions page"
  />

You can easily keep sessions containing a specific page or a sequence of pages, so you can focus your exploration on a workflow.

<Alert type={AlertType.info}>
  You can filter only on pages that have been recorded by the collector. Free-form filter is not (yet) possible.
</Alert>

### How about URLs with a dynamic segment?

When you need to filter on a "type" of page rather than a "specific" page, like for example on generic "product pages" (```/products/<any product>```) rather than "a specific product page" (```/products/my-awesome-product```), you can replace the flexible part of the URL by a wildcard character ("*"):

<Image
    src={imgSessionsFilterWildcard}
    alt="A filter using a wildcard"
  />

## Session details

On a session page, you will find every information to reproduce the journey of a user of your application

<Image
    src={imgSessionDetails}
    alt="A session page, containing all the data recorded during the current session"
  />

The pages they visited are displayed in a chronological order, from left (oldest visit) to right (most recent visit).
For each of these page visit, the list of user actions are displayed. You can expand a user action to display its metadata (see Getting Started - Metadata)

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>
