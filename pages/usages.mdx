The core idea of Gravity is to help you build an **end-to-end test suite** that covers efficiently the most important features and paths for your users. This is where the **Usages** section of Gravity can help.

## What is a usage?

In Gravity, a usage is an ordered sequence of user actions within the same page or across multiple pages.
When a user or test session go through all the steps of a usage, it will be considered as fulfilled (for a user session) or covered (for a test session)

For example, a "Login" usage can look like this:

[SCREENSHOT login usage]

## Define new usages

You can define a new usage from a session page:

[SCREENSHOT 'define new usage' CTA]

A new screen is displayed, allowing you to build the sequence of actions that will be the different steps of the usage:

[SCREENSHOT]

- You can select a whole page and no actions within. It will add a "Any action" event in the usage, meaning that a simple visit of the page will fulfill this step
- You can modify the page address of a usage step to make it dynamic. In the following example, the step will be fulfilled on *any* ```/transactions``` page

## Browse usages

You can find all the usages you defined for you application under the **Usages** section of Gravity
[SCREENSHOT]

For each of them, you can see:

- The steps a session has to go through to consider the usage as fulfilled or covered
- Metrics on the user and test sessions that fulfill or cover the usage

Use these metrics to learn which usages needs more tests and which ones could be less tested
